"AS"= Created using amplify shader. 

Polygonmaker-AS-BasicPBR: Shader with color tint mask (R,G,B)
Polygonmaker-AS-Glass: Basic transparent shader. Opacity multiply Diffuse alpha and Opaque is additive to Diffuse Alpha 

Polygonmaker-AS-Ice: Translucent shader with Refraction.
	-Diffuse with Alpha for opacity
	-Sliders to control opacity,refraction and Chromatic Aberration
	-Color to control the Transmission (SSS effect)
	
Polygonmaker-AS-Skin Defered: Shader with color tint mask (R,G,B) and Fresnel color to simulate hair
Polygonmaker-AS-Skin Forward: Shader with color tint mask (R,G,B) and Fresnel color to simulate hair and Tranlucency

Polygonmaker-AS-SkinCutout Defered DoubleSided: Same as above but for transparent materials.
Polygonmaker-AS-SkinCutout Forward DoubleSided: Same as above but for transparent materials. 
Polygonmaker-AS-SkinCutout Forward Specular DoubleSided: Same as above but for Specular pipeline.

StandardDoubleSided=Unity Standard but double sided.(Default from Unity just set to work double sided)

Polygonmaker_Toon:
-Simple Shader to achieve "Unlit look"
-Shaderforge Shader
-Blinn-Phong Lighting


URP:

Update the AS shaders to work with Universal Render Pipeline.
Toon shaders and StandardDoubleSided will break on URP

HDRP:
Update the AS shaders to work with High Definition Pipeline.
Toon shaders and StandardDoubleSided will break on URP
