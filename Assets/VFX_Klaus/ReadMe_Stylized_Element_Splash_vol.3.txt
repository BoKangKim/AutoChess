Thank you for purchasing the Stylized_Element_Splash_vol.3.
This note describes how this package is configured, how texture should be used, and how it works within a Particle System.

This effect is designed to work in a URP or HRRP and LWRP.

I put all the effect elements into few textures so that each prefab uses the least amount of material.

The structure of the texture is as follows.

   ▷ Red channel is main texture.
   ▷ Green channel is dissolve texture. The main texture gradually dissolve into the shape of green texture.
   ▷ Blue channel gives UV distortion.
   ▷ And Alpha channel.

These effects can be modified by two Custom Data in the Particle System.

There are 4 Components in Custom Data 1.

   ▷ X value is for Dissolve. From 0 to 1, it gradually dissolves.
   ▷ Y value is for Dissolve Sharpness. The larger the number, the sharper the edges of dissolve.
   ▷ Z value is for Distortion. The larger the number, the stronger the distortion.
   ▷ W value is for Soft Particle Factor. As the number goes to zero, the overlap of mesh becomes transparent.

You can use Custom Data 2 to add highlight colors.
If you don't want to use the highlight color, change the custom data 2 mode to 'Disabled'.

There are four materials in my package and all materials use only one shader.

You can see the names "Mat_fx_ --- _highlight_outer" and "Mat_fx_ --- _highlight_inner".
This name literally indicates whether the highlight will be on the outside or inside.
For example, If you use "Mat_fx_ --- _highlight_outer", the highlight color of effect will appear outside.

Each material has two parameters "Highlight_Min" and "Highlight_Max".
By adjusting the two parameters, you can change the thickness of the highlight.

All materials use only one shader.

Material and shader named "Explosion_lab" are not used for effects. It was used in the background of Scene just to show the effect.

Thank you once again, and I hope my effect will be useful for your development.
